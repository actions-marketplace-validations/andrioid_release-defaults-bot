# Release Defaults

Ever needed to release something without having the time to write release notes? Ever found yourself reading the commit log to be able to tell someone what changes are in the release?

**Release Defaults** drafts release-notes for releases that don't have a body.

## Goals (and non-goals)

- [x] Pull-Request Overview
- [x] Direct Commit Collapsed Overview
- [x] Less annoying than commit-log
- [ ] Organize by PR labels
- [ ] Allow some customization

### Non Goals

- Customer Ready or picture perfect
- Project specific additions that can't be solved with a configuration

## How Release Defaults works

1. Every time it finds an empty release body, it activates (created, edited, etc)
2. It fetches a list of releases that are older (according to semver)
3. It compares the current release to the last one
4. It finds all the pull-requests for the difference and grabs the details.
5. A new release note body is created
   - Pull-Requests
   - Collapsed list of commits that don't belong to a PR
   - Lists release-notes for previous releases of the same major+minor version. E.g. 1.0.1 will list 1.0.0 as a previous release, but not 0.9.1.
